# How to Create a Custom CentOS 9 Stream VM on Azure

## Prerequisites
- Access to Azure portal with appropriate permissions.
- Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (Standard D4s v5) with Hyper-V installed

## Azure Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure your custom VM meets the following Azure requirements:

- **Disk Format:** Currently, only fixed VHD is supported.
- **Generation:** Azure supports both Gen1 (BIOS boot) and Gen2 (UEFI boot) virtual machines. For this guide, we'll focus on Gen1.
- **Disk Space:** Ensure a minimum of 6GB of disk space.
- **Partitioning:** Use default partitions instead of LVM or RAID configurations.
- **Swap:** Disable swap as Azure does not support a swap partition on the OS disk.
- **Virtual Size:** All VHDs on Azure must have a virtual size aligned to 1 MB.
- **Supported File Systems:** While XFS is now the default file system, ext4 is still supported.


## Step 1: Download CentOS 9 Stream ISO
1. Visit the official CentOS website or a trusted mirror.
2. Download the CentOS 9 Stream ISO image, [Centos 9 Bootable Image](http://mirror.stream.centos.org/9-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/iso/CentOS-Stream-9-latest-x86_64-boot.iso)

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) in Hyper-V
1. Open Hyper-V Manager.
2. Click on "Action" in the menu bar.
3. Select "New" and then "Hard Disk".
4. Follow the wizard to create a new VHD with appropriate size and settings. The following steps illustrate the process:

### Choose VHD Format:
- Select the desired VHD format. For Azure compatibility, choose "VHD".

## Step 6: Prepare the Virtual Machine for Generalization 
1. Run the CentOS-Generalize-Script.sh ([Azur Documentation Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-centos))
2. When the Virtual machine powers off, Close the Virtual machine Window
3. Locate the VHD, in "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Virtual Hard Disks"

## Step 7: Uploading VHD to Azure
There are two ways to do this:
1. Using AzCopy
2. Using Azure Storage Explorer (Recommended)

Note: Ensure VHD is uploaded as a **Page Blob**.

## Step 8: Creating Virtual machine in Azure From VHD

1. **Create a Managed Disk**: Once the VHD is uploaded, you need to create a Managed Disk from the VHD file. Managed Disks simplify disk management in Azure and are required for creating virtual machines.
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the "Disks" service.
   - Click on "Create disk" and provide the necessary details, including the name, resource group, and storage type (Premium or Standard).
   - Choose "Blob storage" as the source type and select the VHD file from your storage account.
   - Specify other settings such as disk size and encryption, then click "Review + create" to create the managed disk.

2. **Create Virtual Machine**: Once the managed disk is created, you can use it to create a virtual machine.
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the "Virtual machines" service.
   - Click on "Create virtual machine" and provide the necessary details, including the name, resource group, region, and availability options.
   - In the "Disks" section of the virtual machine creation wizard, select "Attach existing disks".
   - Choose the managed disk you created from the dropdown menu.
   - Continue configuring other settings such as network, management, and monitoring.
   - Review and create the virtual machine.

3. **Reset SSH Configuration**:
   - Once the VM is stopped, navigate to the "Reset password" blade in the Azure portal.
   - Choose the "Reset SSH public key" option.
   - Follow the prompts to reset the SSH public key.
**Note:** This action will add your SSH key to the default azureuser user and allow you to SSH into the Virtual machine

4. **Add New SSH Public Key**:
   - After resetting the SSH configuration, navigate to the "SSH keys" blade in the Azure portal.
   - Click on the "Add" button to add a new SSH public key.
   - Paste your new SSH public key into the provided field. Ensure that you have the correct format and that it is a valid SSH public key.
   - Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
 
5. **Access the Virtual Machine**: Connect to it using SSH
   ```
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/pathTo/privatekey azureuser@<vm ip address>
   ```

## Step 9: Creating a CentOS 9 Generalized Image in Azure
1. **Deallocate the Virtual Machine**:
   - Stop the VM to deallocate its compute resources.
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the VM you want to capture.
   - Click on "Stop" to deallocate the VM.

2. **Capture the Virtual Machine**:
   - After deallocating the VM, navigate to the "Images" section in the Azure portal.
   - Click on "Add" to create a new image.
   - Provide details such as name, resource group, and location for the image.
   - Select the deallocated VM as the source for the image.
   - Follow the wizard to complete the image creation process.

3. **Create or Select a Shared Image Gallery**:
   - If you haven't already created a Shared Image Gallery, you can do so from the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to the "Shared Image Galleries" section and click on "Add gallery".
   - Provide details such as name, subscription, resource group, and location for the gallery.
   - Alternatively, if you already have a Shared Image Gallery, navigate to it in the portal.

4. **Create an Image Definition**:
   - Within the Shared Image Gallery, create an "Image definition" for the captured VM image.
   - Provide details such as name, resource group, location, and specify the VM image you created in the previous step.

5. **Create an Image Version**:
   - After creating the image definition, create an "Image version" for the VM image.
   - Specify the version number and any other relevant details.

6. **Review and Publish**:
   - Review the details of the image version and publish it to the Shared Image Gallery.
